This was a large project that is missing some pieces (node modules) that may be vital to run out of the box, but it is an example of one of my first django projects and my first one involving react.  See the link to Tech with Tim's Github for a more working version if interested.  This project is a web app to manage music for a party with multiple rooms.  Each room has a host who then can control the music for that room with a playlist on a premium Spotify account.  If the host allows, other guests can vote to skip the current song and if there are enough votes Spotify skips to the next song on the playlist.  The host can also adjust the required amount of votes needed to skip a song.
